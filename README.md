# declaratia

All configuration in one place, powered by Nix.

`decalratia` is a mirror repo with `flake.lock` removed for security reasons.

## Hosts

- `akahi`: my FX507ZR laptop as daily driver, powered by [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)
- `perimadeia`: VPS running nothing, maybe Minecraft

More machines to be migrated to this flake.
